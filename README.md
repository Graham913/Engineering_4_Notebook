## Launch Pad Part 1

### Assignment Description

the assignment was to get a serial moniter to print a countdown from 10 to 0 then print lift off at 0. It was to mimic a rocket launch.

### Evidence 

Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here. You need to communicate what your thing does. 

### Wiring

N/A

### Code
Give me a link to your code. [Something like this](https://github.com/millerm22/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Raspberry_Pi/hello_world.py). Don't make me hunt through your folders, give me a nice link to click to take me there! Remember to **COMMENT YOUR CODE** if you want full credit. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!

## Launch Pad Part 2 (lights)

### Assignment description

The assignment was to take the previous code of the countdown and add lights. Every time it counts down one the red LED blinks and when the countdown reaches 0 it blinks green.
